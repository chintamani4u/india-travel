7.x-1.0-beta5
-------------

Says beta5 now...change to a stable release number

7.x-1.1
-------

Added validation function into the file field for image provider; intent of the validation function is to 
prevent uploading broken images or images that don't match their extension. 

The functions are available in tieto_materialbank.module. Please note that the validation currently resides 
on the fact that file module does not detect the file mimetype correctly, instead it grabs it from the extension.

This is subject to change, if it does change we will have to modify this function accordingly.
